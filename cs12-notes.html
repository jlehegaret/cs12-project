The improvements made to this website would not have been possible without the indulgence of the CS-12 staff, who allowed me to continue to work on something I was really excited about rather than holding me to an earlier, less inspiring idea.  Thank you, Kenyon!

Here is a log of the resulting, CS-E12-oriented improvements:

- cleaned out remnants of dead ends (unused JavaScript libraries and CSS files)

- reduced visual clutter by replacing side nav menu (which didn't collapse) and the "Where Am I" status messages with a new horizontal header containing navigation and filter options.

- generate a legend using svg and css rather than an embedded image

- rotated the contributors graph and worked with box model to improve spacing of names and bars versus slider.

- worked extensively with flexbox to relayout the page

- investigated linear gradients for colors to apply them to legend boxes
